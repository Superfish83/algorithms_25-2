# Algorithms HW #4-2: Shortest Path Algorithms
- Author: Yeonjun Kim (2024-13755)
- Date: 2025-11-05
- Programmed and tested in Arch Linux environment.

## Features
- dijkstra(graph, s)
- bellman_ford(graph, s)

## How to run
- Before running the program, you should place `input.txt` in this directory. In `input.txt`, you write the graph edges and the starting node.
- I verified the implementation for edge cases in `test_cases/`
- You can run the program by `$ python3 202413755_Task4.py`, and see the results in `output.txt`.
